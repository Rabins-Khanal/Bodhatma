# Frontend Payment Integration Guide

## Overview

The frontend has been successfully updated to support both COD and Khalti payment methods. The implementation is complete and ready for testing.

## ✅ What's Already Implemented

### 1. Payment Method Selection
- Radio buttons for COD and Khalti payment methods
- Clear visual indicators for each payment option
- Default selection is COD

### 2. COD Payment Flow
- Direct order creation with `paymentMethod: "cod"`
- `paymentStatus: "pending"` for COD orders
- Immediate order confirmation

### 3. Khalti Payment Flow
- Integration with Khalti checkout widget
- Proper amount conversion (multiplied by 100 for paisa)
- Success/Error/Close event handling
- Order creation with complete Khalti data

### 4. Order Data Structure
The frontend sends the correct data structure to the backend:

```javascript
// For COD orders
{
  allProduct: [...],
  user: "user_id",
  amount: 1500,
  address: "...",
  phone: "...",
  paymentMethod: "cod",
  paymentStatus: "pending"
}

// For Khalti orders
{
  allProduct: [...],
  user: "user_id",
  amount: 1500,
  address: "...",
  phone: "...",
  paymentMethod: "khalti",
  paymentStatus: "completed",
  transactionId: "khalti_transaction_id",
  khaltiData: { /* Khalti response */ }
}
```

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

### 1. Create `.env` file in the client directory:

```env
# API Configuration
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Khalti Configuration
# For testing, use the test public key
REACT_APP_KHALTI_PUBLIC_KEY=test_public_key_dc74e0fd57cb46cd93832aee0a390234

# For production, replace with your actual Khalti public key
# REACT_APP_KHALTI_PUBLIC_KEY=your_actual_khalti_public_key
```

### 2. Khalti Public Key Setup:

**For Testing:**
- Use the test public key: `test_public_key_dc74e0fd57cb46cd93832aee0a390234`
- Test credentials: Mobile `9800000000`, PIN `0000`

**For Production:**
- Get your public key from Khalti merchant dashboard
- Replace the test key with your actual public key
